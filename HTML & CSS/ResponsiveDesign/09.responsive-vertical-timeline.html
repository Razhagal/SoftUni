                        web in a document called “Information Management: A
                        Proposal”. Believe it or not, Tim’s initial proposal
                        was not immediately accepted. In fact, his boss at
                        the time, Mike Sendall, noted the words “Vague but
                        exciting” on the cover.

                        Tim had written the three fundamental technologies
                        that remain the foundation of today’s web (and which
                        you may have seen appear on parts of your web
                        browser): HTML: HyperText Markup Language. The
                        markup (formatting) language for the web. URI:
                        Uniform Resource Identifier. A kind of “address”
                        that is unique and used to identify to each resource
                        on the web. It is also commonly called a URL. HTTP:
                        Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Allows for the
                        retrieval of linked resources from across the web.

                        Tim moved from CERN to the Massachusetts Institute
                        of Technology to found the World Wide Web Consortium
                        (W3C), an international community devoted to
                        developing open web standards. He remains the
